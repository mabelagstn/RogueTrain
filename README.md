# Rogue Train

This project was inspired by a blog from Open Government Products, entitled "How the Circle Line rogue train was caught with data." This mission involves analyzing train breakdown data to identify a malfunctioning "rogue train" using abstract data types (ADTs) and filtering techniques.
