# Rogue Train

This project was inspired by a blog post from Open Government Products, titled "How the Circle Line rogue train was caught with data." This mission involves analyzing train breakdown data to identify a malfunctioning "rogue train" using abstract data types (ADTs) and filtering techniques.

Key highlights of this project:
1. Implemented an ADT to represent a trainâ€™s position on a line, including movement status, direction, and nearby stations.
2. Processed train schedule data to filter events based on specific conditions.
3. Calculated blame scores for trains near breakdown events.
4. Identified the train with the maximum blame score as the rogue train.
